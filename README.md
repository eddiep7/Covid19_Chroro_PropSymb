# Lab 3 - Covid-19 Cases and Rates in the US (Choropleth & Proportional Symbol Map Visulizations)

## Map 1: US Case Rates of Covid Cases in 2020

Map 1 is a Choropleth Map visualization that represents the number of Covid-19 cases among different counties around the whole US. The scale is based on a sequential color hue, with lighter colors representing fewer and less severe cases, while darker colors represent larger and more extreme numbers of cases. A legend is provided to show how the color and data are connected, and you can click or hover over a specific county to see the name of the area along with the number of associated cases.

## Map 2: US Covid-19 Count in 2020

Map 2 is a Proportional Symbols Map visualization that utilizes different sizes of circles and colors to represent the Covid-19 counts once again across every county in the US. With three different scales, similar to Map 1, it utilizes a sequential color scheme but can also represent the severity based on the size of the circle, providing a visual comparison. You are able to click on each circle to figure out the value of Covid-19 counts in that particular area for the year 2020.
